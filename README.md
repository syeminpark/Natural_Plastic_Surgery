### Story
A system to help anyone practice strecthing their eyelids 
in the hope of making their eyes bigger in a natural?(zero budget) way.

As long as your eyes are opened bigger than the criteria, the arduino-powered 
motor pumps apple juice as a prize. 
  

### Computer Vision Process

1. HaarCascade to detect face
2. Dlib Shape Detector to detect eyes and crop region
3. CNN to classify of eyes are opened or closed

  
### AI Dataset
Closed Eyes In The Wild
  

### Physical Computing
Arduino & pySerial
